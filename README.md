![heroku](https://github.com/juntaolei/night-owl-backend/workflows/Heroku%20CI/badge.svg)

Night Owl allows users to check where parties are as well as how fun those parties are,
saving you from a potentially disappointing event. With this app, you can browse all available
parties created by other users. You can read the reviews for a party and rate the party
yourself.
